# datasetbuilding
Data engineering project aimed to build a dataset of online poker games.  

I wrote this code last year (July 2020) when I started to get into the data world. It was mainly developed to study Spin & Go tournaments, but it might work generally. It performs well, but regex can certainly be improved. Also, today I wouldnâ€™t use so many conditions and loops that take a lot of time to process. Finally, some older poker players have logins with special characters and this might affect data. I usually find about 2% of corrupt data because of that.
