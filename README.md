## Dataset building

### Description  
This is a data engineering project aimed to build a dataset from online poker games.  I wrote this code in July 2020, when I started to get into the data world. It was mainly developed to study _Spin & Go tournaments_, but it might work more generally. It performs well, but _Regex_ can certainly be improved. Also, today I wouldnâ€™t use so many conditionals and loops that take a lot of time to process.

In summary, this project provides a way to convert hand history files into structured data. Here is an example of a hand history, generated by the poker platforms when you play a hand:
```
MyPokerStudies Hand #216746978471: Tournament #2967580470, $0.23+$0.02 USD Hold'em No Limit - Level I (10/20) - 2020/07/24 14:21:17 BRT [2020/07/24 13:21:17 ET]
Table '2967580470 1' 3-max Seat #1 is the button
Seat 1: villain_A (60 in chips) 
Seat 2: garciamurilo (910 in chips) 
Seat 3: villain_B (530 in chips) 
garciamurilo: posts small blind 10
villain_B: posts big blind 20
*** HOLE CARDS ***
Dealt to garciamurilo [9s Td]
villain_A: folds 
garciamurilo: calls 10
villain_B: checks 
*** FLOP *** [Kd Qh 3c]
garciamurilo: checks 
villain_B: checks 
*** TURN *** [Kd Qh 3c] [8s]
garciamurilo: checks 
villain_B: bets 40
garciamurilo: folds 
Uncalled bet (40) returned to villain_B
villain_B collected 40 from pot
villain_B: doesn't show hand 
*** SUMMARY ***
Total pot 40 | Rake 0 
Board [Kd Qh 3c 8s]
Seat 1: villain_A (button) folded before Flop (didn't bet)
Seat 2: garciamurilo (small blind) folded on the Turn
Seat 3: villain_B (big blind) collected (40)
```
<br>  Processing this example with my _R_ code, you will get tree rows, one for each player with detailed information of all their actions and profits. Here it is:

After exploring many possibilities, I found out that it was the perfect structure to get a good exploratory data analysis of my tournaments. So I was able to transform and plot data to get insights about my game and to study my opponents. An example: <br>

### Limitations
Some older poker players have logins with special characters that used to be allowed in the past, and this might affect data quality. I usually find about 2% of corrupted data because of that and I just exclude them. It might be possible to escape special characters at some stage of the process and keep all data safe, but I have been too busy lately to fix this (or any other) point.

### Usage 
Download all files and run the _functions.R_ file in your _RStudio_. Then, open the _execute.R_, set the directory of your hand history files and the other variables. After running it, you will get a _result.csv_ with your structured data.
