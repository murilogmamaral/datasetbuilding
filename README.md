## Dataset building

### Description  
This is a data engineering project aimed to build a dataset of online poker games.  I wrote this code in July 2020, when I started to get into the data world. It was mainly developed to study _Spin & Go tournaments_, but it might work generally. It performs well, but _Regex_ can certainly be improved. Also, today I wouldnâ€™t use so many conditionals and loops that take a lot of time to process.

### Limitations
Some older poker players have logins with special characters that used to be allowed in the past, and this might affect data. I usually find about 2% of corrupt data because of that and I just ignore them. It might possible to scape special characters at some stage of the process and keep this data, but I have not been free time these days to improve this point.

### Usage 
Download all files and run the _functions.R_ file in your RStudio. Then, open the _execute.R_, set the directory of your hand history files and the other variables demanded. After running, you will get a _result.csv_, with the structure described below in the *Data Dictionary*.
